# Notebook examples for Raman spectroscopy

Authors: Charles Le Losq

Notebook names indicate the type of treatment performed as well as the language used.

Three Python and Julia libraries are currently used to perform the treatment: RamPy, Spectra.jl and gcvspline.

We advise using the Container stacks provided at https://github.com/rses-datascience/Containers to run the examples.

* Note that the Container stack needs to be updated. For Python example, use Google Colab; For Julia, use JuliaBox.

The folder rameau contains example of using the rameau() function of the Spectra.jl to treat Raman spectra and get water content estimates from them.
